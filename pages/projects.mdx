## TEX (May 2022)

This project participated in 'HackMoney 2022', organized by ETHGlobal, the global developer community of Ethereum. We developed a MEV-resistant DEX named TEX, and successfully clinched the finalist position. The primary functionality involves encrypting transactions, generating proofs (zero-knowledge proof) for valid encryption, allowing for pre-verification of transaction content, and preventing potential attacks such as front-running and sandwiching attacks.
